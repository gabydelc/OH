      Abnormal heart enlargement occurs because the heart muscle is weakened by an underlying disease process; the heart dilates to partially compensate for the weakened pumping action of the heart as a result of disease.<br>
      In contrast, athletes tend to have enlarged hearts because of the amount of stress they place on the heart's pumping requirements to fuel their training and competing. So some degree of heart enlargement in athletes is usually a normal response to exercise. Endurance athletes, tend to have larger chamber sizes while strength athletes, tend to have thicker muscle walls.<br>
