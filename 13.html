         <p><strong>Billiards</strong>
          <br>
        </br>
        Billiards evolved from a lawn game similar to croquet played sometime during the 15th century in Northern Europe (probably in France). <br>
        The term "poolroom" now means a place where billiards is played, but in the 19th century a poolroom was a betting parlor for horse racing. Billiard tables were installed so patrons could pass the time between races. The game of billiards and the poolroom became connected in the public's mind. Today, the two terms are used interchangeably.
