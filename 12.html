        From Eames to Gehry, countless design visionaries have left their mark on the American rocking chair, creating an object that synthesizes both napping and modernism. <br>
        The first rocking chair was invented in 1710 by tying two ice skates to the bottom of a chair, but it wasn't till 1787 that "rocking chair" finally entered the Oxford English Dictionary for Usage. At this time, rocking chairs were often designed for two or more people: a mother and child, an elderly person and his or her nurse, Beyonce and Jay, etc.
